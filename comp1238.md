## Week 4: Keyboards and Editors:
- QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak are the most popular keyboard layouts

  -Regex (Regular Expressions): For pattern matching.
  -Example: line\d+ finds "line" followed by digits.

## Week 5: CLI
- CLI stands for Command Line Interface
- Some functionalities are only available via CLI.
- Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces.
- Easier automation through scripting.
- Efficient for remote work with low bandwidth requirements.
- Minimal resource usage on computers.
- List of basic commands include:
  -ls: List files in a directory.
  -cd: Change directory.
  -pwd: Print working directory.
  -cat: Display file contents.
  -less: View file contents interactively.
  -cp: Copy files.
  -mv: Move files.
  -mkdir: Create a directory.
  -ping: Test network connectivity.
- Remote Access Methods include SSH (secure shell), allows command line access to remote computers
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
